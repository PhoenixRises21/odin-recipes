    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This avocado egg bake is simple and fun to make. I had these clever breakfast treats at a brunch gathering. The recipe is easy to make for two people and can be doubled or tripled for a crowd. I use a muffin tin to hold each avocado half when making multiple servings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Avocado, Halved and Pitted</li>

        <li>Two Whole Eggs</li>

        <li>Pinch of Cayeene Pepper</li>

        <li>Salt and Ground Black Pepper to Taste</li>

        <li>1/4 Cup of Cooked Crumbled Bacon</li>

        <li>Fresh Chopped Chives</li>
    </ul>  
    
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place each avocado half in a ramekin. Crack 1 egg into each avocado half; season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until egg is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle each avocado with crumbled bacon and chives.</li>
    <li>ENJOY!</li>
